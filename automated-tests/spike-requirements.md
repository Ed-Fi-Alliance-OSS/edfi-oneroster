# Automated tests spike requirements

## Description

OneRoster Certification doesn’t have tests around validity of data. To ensure the logic in the views are accurate we will need additional tests.

__Investigate options including the following:__

- View validation via database level scripts based on Grandbend dataset
- Postman/Bruno tests that check and validate data consistency between OneRoster and Ed-Fi API's for the OneRoster API end-points (ideally without taking dependency on a specific dataset)

## Acceptance Criteria

- Spike results document and recommendation
- Tickets for next steps
